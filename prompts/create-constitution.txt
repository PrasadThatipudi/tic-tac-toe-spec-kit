This is a game development project.

We are building browser-based games using TypeScript and Canvas.

Architecture Rules:
- All games must use a finite state machine
- Game loop must be isolated from rendering
- No business logic inside UI components

Testing:
- All core logic must be unit tested
- Game mechanics must be deterministic

Specs:
- Every feature must define:
  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - State transitions
  - Edge cases
  - Failure cases

Code Quality:
- No hardcoded magic numbers
- All constants must be centralized
- Clear separation of engine and game logic
